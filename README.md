  ## Description
      
  I was motivated to build this project so that I can have one place where s someone  who might  want to  hire  me or  see my work can find all my details on one location'
  I build this porfolio to have a presence online and also continue to mporove my react slills in the process 
  It solves the problem of having to have a business card/ links to all my projects as well as a form to contact me directly
  I learnt more about react-router-dom how to add pdf files in react, creating a brand and  more
